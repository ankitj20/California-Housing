# California-Housing
In this project, I trained ML models to predict prices of houses in California housing dataset. 

This dataset contains missing values and text attributes, so i created a pipeline to take care of them. Also, since income is a important attribute when it comes to buying house, i created a test set such that it is representative of the income attribute.
